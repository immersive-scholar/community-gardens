            I really started to understand the representations of the data by
            just looking at the gardens. It's really an experience; our
            community is so diverse in its successes and its disparity. It
            really hit home in the GPA gardens because you see a good range of
            people denoting that everyone can do it, but that high GPA is also
            experienced through lack of resources, different types of outside
            pressures, anxiety etc.
